# Ray Tracer
This is a university assignment for Computer Graphics.
The task was to implement a ray tracer that rendered a fixed scene. It had to have a certain set of features (See the assignment pdf), for example: a reflective surface and a textured surface.
I chose to complete my assignment in the Rust programming language instead of C++ (for which we had sample code provided)

For extra marks I parallelized the rendering (using a rust library called Rayon) and displayed the results in real-time.
